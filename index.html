						<p class="lead">Ken Kaneki, an 18 year old attending Kamii University in Tokyo, is thrilled to be going on a date with Rize, a girl he has been eyeing from his table at the Anteiku Cafe. After a date at a book store, Kaneki walks her home through the deserted back alleys of Tokyo as the sun sets. While walking past an empty contruction site Rize reveals to Kaneki that she is a ghoul, before taking a large bite out of his shoulder.</p>

						<p>Set in modern day Tokyo, Tokyo Ghoul follows the life of Ken Kaneki, a university student who falls victim to a ghoul, a species identical to humans that can only derive nourishment from thre flesh of humans. Before he is killed by the ghoul, named Rize, multiple steel beams that were held by a crane fall onto the two, killing Rize and badly injuring Kaneki. Both are taken to a hospital where Rize is pronounced dead and a doctor, desperate to save Kaneki's life, transplants Rize's organs into him without her families consent. After waking in the hospital, Kaneki finds himself turning into a ghoul, having had a ghouls organs transplanted into him. The story follows his journey to find a place to call home, and eventually unite both species, humans and ghouls, who have fought for centuries.
						</p>

						<p>Set up in a similar fashion to a vampire novel, instead using ghouls, thought of as monsters by the majority of the human population. From the beginning we see the media treating ghouls similarly to terrorists, warning the population of where each ghoul attack takes place and how to identify a ghoul. Ishida also creates a counter-ghoul government enitity, the CCG (the Commision of Counter Ghoul), and focuses on two characters within it, Kureo Mado and Koutarou Amon, who are 'ghoul investigators' trsined and paid to track down and murder ghouls with quinques, weapons made specifically for the killing of ghouls. The two become the primary antagonists for the first part of the story as they murder a newly made friend of Kaneki's, a ghoul named Ryouko Fueguchi, mother of Hinami Fueguchi, a child who Kaneki narrowly saves from the investigators, covering her eyes so she does not have to witness the killing of her mother. The investigators hunt down Hinami, knowing she is a ghoul and the daughter of Ryouko. When they find her, Kaneki and Touka, another ghoul friend of Kaneki's, rescue her, with Kaneki engaging in combat with an investigator for the first time.
                        </p>

						<p>Ishida's art style definately lends to the story, being rough and not sparing the reader of any graphic details. The background behind each panel appropriately becoming dark during fight scenes and in times when Kaneki is being tortured, both physically and mentally by the events of the story and the dark world of ghouls. The rough sketching suits the story very well, although sometimes making scenes hard to follow. For the most part however, it is made clear what is happening at all times, no matter how gory or dark, and excellently capturing the atmosphere of the story, making it easy for the reader to picture the events in their head.
                        </p>
                        
                        <blockquote><p>I'm not the protagonist of a novel or anything. I'm just a college student who likes to read, like you could find anywhere. But... if, for argument's sake, you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be... a tragedy - Ken Kaneki</p></blockquote>
                        
						<p>Over the course of the story, the above quote from the first chapter, proves to be very true. Tokyo Ghoul is entirely a horror manga, a psycological thriller. There is no comedy, and there are no cute moments, the story is written entirely about Kaneki's pain and the pain of the others in the fictional reality, showing it graphically, as well as through the characters emotions. The story focuses on many things, the accident of birth, <i>"the unfairness of God"</i>, and pain. The story is told through the characters pain, physicall and mentally torturing and abusing them, showing their real selves and the struggles of their life, especially that of ghouls.</p>

						<p>Despite the dark nature, the story is wll written and very well told by Ishida, and I would definately recommend it to people who enjoy phsycological thrillers and dark, heavy themes. I definately do not reccomend Tokyo Ghoul to anyone squeamish or to anyone who is affected heavily by stories, as well as people suffering from depression and anxiety, which may be triggered by certain events. Personally, I rate Tokyo Ghoul a 9.5/10, with only one or two things I could think of that could be improved. A great series for people into those sort of things, but not recommended for others who may be affected negatively.</p>
